RGBD image sequence relocalization with Inverse Neural Radiance fields

==== TBD ====
double prec?
Asserts? Sanity checks
Loss functions
random-feature-patch
batching
BFGS-least squares

==== IN PROGRESS ====
Multiple Image ~10
synthetic -> llff
per pixel gradient per dim histogram
SGD test
One image convergence region

==== DONE ====
Huber loss
white mask
	reference image - pixel sampling
	rendered image - mask
translation-rotation error
XLA <-> vmap
draw image
feature points
saving test results
